# Forecasting Premier League Goals Using Statistical and Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project analyses Premier League match data to model and predict the number of goals scored by teams. The aim is to apply econometric and predictive modelling techniques to understand goal-scoring patterns and evaluate forecasting performance.

## Research Question
How many goals will a Premier League team score in a given match, and how well can statistical models predict these outcomes?

## Data
- Premier League match data (multiple seasons)
- Variables include teams, goals scored, home advantage and match context

## Methods
- Exploratory data analysis
- Poisson regression for goal modelling
- Optional comparison with a simple machine learning classifier

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Status
Work in progress.
